            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I am a data science fanatic who spends much time studying and applies practical experience in machine learning and python development. I find great pleasure in transforming complex data into easy action-oriented intelligence and rejoices in any collaborative innovative work effort. My journey, however, started much earlier from coming up with approaches toward trading to building algorithms for forecasting. It has been shaped through an endless curiosity, an insatiable urge to learn, and solve real-life problems.</p>
